	<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
	<h3>BY ROBERT FROST</h3>
</div>
<div class ="paragraphs">
	<p id= Para1>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,	<br>
	And sorry I could not travel both<br>
	And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
	And looked down one as far as I could<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

	<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
	And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
	Though as for that the passing there<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,</p>

	<p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
	In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
	I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

	<p class= "Para4">I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
	I took the one less traveled by,<br>
	And that has made all the difference.</p>
